<h2>Linked Lists</h2>
<p>A linked-list is a sequence of data structures which are connected together via links.</p>
<p>Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list the second most used data structure after array. Following are important terms to understand the concepts of Linked List.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Link</b> &minus; Each Link of a linked list can store a data called an element.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Next</b> &minus; Each Link of a linked list contain a link to next link called Next.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LinkedList</b> &minus; A LinkedList contains the connection link to the first Link called First.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Linked List Representation</h2>
<p>Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.</p>

<p>As per above shown illustration, following are the important points to be considered.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>LinkedList contains an link element called first.</li>
<li>Each Link carries a data field(s) and a Link Field called next.</li>
<li>Each Link is linked with its next link using its next link.</li>
<li>Last Link carries a Link as null to mark the end of the list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Linked List</h2>
<p>Following are the various flavours of linked list.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Simple Linked List</b> &minus; Item Navigation is forward only.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Doubly Linked List</b> &minus; Items can be navigated forward and backward way.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Circular Linked List</b> &minus; Last item contains link of the first element as next and and first element has link to last element as prev.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>Following are the basic operations supported by a list.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Insertion</b> &minus; add an element at the beginning of the list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Deletion</b> &minus; delete an element at the beginning of the list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Display</b> &minus; displaying complete list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Search</b> &minus; search an element using given key.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Delete</b> &minus; delete an element using given key.</p></li>
