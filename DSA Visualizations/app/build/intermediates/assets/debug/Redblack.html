<h2>What is Red-black Tree</h2>
<p>Red-black trees are an evolution of binary search trees that aim to keep
    the tree balanced without affecting the complexity of the primitive
    operations. This is done by coloring each node in the tree with either red
    or black and preserving a set of properties that guarantee that the deepest
    path in the tree is not longer than twice the shortest one.</p>

    <p>A red-black tree is a binary search tree with the following
    properties:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Every node is colored with either red or black.</li>

        <li>All leaf (nil) nodes are colored with black; if a node’s child is
        missing then we will assume that it has a nil child in that place and
        this nil child is always colored black.</li>

        <li>Both children of a red node must be black nodes.</li>

        <li>Every path from a node n to a descendent leaf has the same number
        of black nodes (not counting node n). We call this number the
        <strong>black height</strong> of n, which is denoted by bh(n).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Figure 5 shows an example of a red-black tree.</p>

    <p>Using these properties, we can show in two steps that a red-black tree
    which contains n nodes has a height of O(log n), thus all primitive
    operations on the tree will be of O(log n) since their order is a function
    of tree height.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, notice that for a red-black tree with height h, bh(root) is
        at least h/2 by property 3 above (as each red node strictly requires
        black children).</li>

        <li>The next step is to use the following lemma:

            <ul>
                <li>Lemma: A subtree rooted at node v has at least 2^bh(v) – 1
                internal nodes</li>

                <li>Proof by induction: The basis is when h(v) = 0, which means
                that v is a leaf node and therefore bh(v) = 0 and the subtree
                rooted at node v has 2^bh(v)-1 = 2^0-1 = 1-1 = 0 nodes.</li>

                <li>Inductive hypothesis: if node v1 with height x has
                2^bh(v1)-1 internal nodes then node v2 with height x+1 has
                2^bh(v2)-1</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>For any non-leaf node v (height &gt; 0) we can see that the black height
    of any of its two children is at least equal to bh(v)-1 &#8212; if the child is
    black, that is, otherwise it is equal to bh(v) . By applying the hypothesis
    above we conclude that each child has at least 2^[bh(v)-1]-1 internal
    nodes, accordingly node v has at least<br />
    2^[bh(v)-1]-1 + 2^[bh(v)-1]-1 + 1 = 2^bh(v)-1<br />
    internal nodes, which ends the proof.</p>

    <p>By applying the lemma to the root node (with bh of at least h/2, as
    shown above) we get<br />
    n &gt;= 2^(h/2) – 1<br />
    where n is the number of internal nodes of a red-black tree (the subtree
    rooted at the root). Playing with the equation a little bit we get h &lt;=
    2 log (n+1), which guarantees the logarithmic bound of red-black trees.</p>

    <p>How does inserting or deleting nodes affect a red-black tree? To ensure
    that its color scheme and properties don&#8217;t get thrown off, red-black trees
    employ a key operation known as <strong>rotation</strong>. Rotation is a
    binary operation, between a parent node and one of its children, that swaps
    nodes and modifys their pointers while preserving the inorder traversal of
    the tree (so that elements are still sorted).</p>

    <p>There are two types of rotations: left rotation and right rotation. Left
    rotation swaps the parent node with its right child, while right rotation
    swaps the parent node with its left child. Here are the steps involved in
    for left rotation (for right rotations just change &#8220;left&#8221; to &#8220;right&#8221;
    below):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Assume node x is the parent and node y is a non-leaf right
        child.</li>

        <li>Let y be the parent and x be its left child.</li>

        <li>Let y’s left child be x’s right child.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="bodySubtitle">Operations on red-black tree (insertion,
    deletion and retrieval)</span></p>

    <p>Red-black tree operations are a modified version of BST operations, with
    the modifications aiming to preserve the properties of red-black trees
    while keeping the operations complexity a function of tree height.</p>
